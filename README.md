Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

My lab 0 includes 3 html files which talk about me and my two families, my blockmates, and my family at home.
I decided to display my blockmates in a table to show their names, home state, and pictures. Because I have a small family, I showed them with our Christmas photo from a couple of years ago. I worked on understanding the design capabilities of CSS by varying colors and text properties, and I used these properties along with pictures to try to make my design clean. The people seen are some of the most important people in my life, and I wanted to share about myself by showing them off.
